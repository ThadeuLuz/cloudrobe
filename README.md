### About

Amanda Cavallaro thinks ‘Your Closet’ – the Android app that organises your clothes – is a work of
genius. And she has ideas about making it even better.

So, she’s planning to fix it with her own two hands. That’s kind of her thing. She has this knack for
looking at software, dreaming of improvements and bringing them to life.

“Imagine someone saying ‘What should I wear today?’ and something like Google Home interacts
with the app, taking weather into account, and suggests an outfit.”


&quot;I love the fact that I can, with my own hands, build an app that can not only improve my own
routine but other people&#39;s out there too,&quot; she says.
